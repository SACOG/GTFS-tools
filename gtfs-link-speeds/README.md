# Getting GTFS Link Speeds

GTFS "Links" for this context refer to the portions of a transit route between each stop. This folder contains scripts related to computing the speeds of individual trips between each pair of stops along a route. Example uses of this data include:
* Identifying where and when auto congestion likely slows down transit speeds
* If compared to observed auto speeds, these data could help inform updating of time factors for modeling transit in SACSIM.
